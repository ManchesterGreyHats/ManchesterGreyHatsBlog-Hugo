Presented by: Tim

An introductory look at the the various tools and techniques for performing man in the middle attacks, as well as the techniques and tips to defend against them.

The presentation will include a few demos of the tools and a show and tell of devices which can be used to make 
the attacks easier.

For those new to MitM attacks, this is a very powerful technique used to intercept and modify network traffic (which is why encryption is so important!).
